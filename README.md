# Biological Scaling Theory

### Overview
This repository uses methods described in the following paper: http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004455

The paper details four methods used to calculating scaling exponents of vascular networks:
1. A conservation based method
1. A ratio based method
1. A regression based method
1. A distribution based method

This repository contains MATLAB code to generate plots to compare data outputted by two versions of vessel extraction software: Angicart (written in OCAML) and Angicart++ (written in C++)

The datasets used in this repository are for academic research purposes and can be found here:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o7fbUU70ivLRVF-NcohQUgnZu-PkPM9U?usp=sharing
* files labeled with a _c extension are outputs of the C++ data (ie. patient1_c.txt)

### Running the Code
Notes:
* The directory with data files must be added to your project path
* Make sure the MATLAB Statistics and Machine Learning toolbox is installed
